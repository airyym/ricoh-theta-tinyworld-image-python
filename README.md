#Ricoh Theta Tiny World Video Conversion

Simple FFMPEG commands and Python Script that decodes the Equirectangular mp4 file
that Ricoh's DualFishEyeBlender creates, splits into an image sequence (15 FPS)
and then using Python scikit-image, adds a tiny world projection, largely inspired by
Rich Wareham's excellent article :
