These command will force the .mp4 video to a series of images, using the ffmpeg tool
https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html

to decode the mp4 file the following command witll split into a series of image sequences
ffmpeg -i yourvideo.mp4"  -an -f image2 "img_%05d.png"

-- if you want the sound from Ricoh Theta you could decode twice and only ouput the audio :
ffmpeg -i "venice.mp4" -vn -acodec copy output.aac

parameters are

-i      : input, the .mp4 or media file 
-an     : turn off the audio **
-r      : FPS, the Ricoh Theta records at 15 PFS, you could do lower but the argument is a division, so 3 = 15/3 = 5
-f      : force the decoding
image 2 : The "%05d" means sequence will have names with 5 digits, img_00001.png, img_00002.png etc.


to encode, it's a reversale of the image sequence in the current directory of image sequences: 

ffmpeg -i img_%05d.png -r 15 -vcodec libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -an out.mp4

parameters are

-i       : the input files, using the naming pattern, which was the same as used when decoding.
-r       : FPS, again this is just to match the Ricoh Theta recording time at 15 PFS
-vcodec  : codec version H.264 video using the encoder x264
-pix_fmt : pixel format, this may or may not be nessecary, I add this so that QuickTime can play the video that was encoded
-an      : turns off audio recording

if you wanted to join the audio that was seperated from the decoding with FFmpeg's installed codecs:

ffmpeg -i output.aac -i out.mp4 -c:v copy -c:a copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc out_complete.mp4
